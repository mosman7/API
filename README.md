# API - Application Programming Interface
An API is a set of rules outlining how you should communicate with other software systems.


### Restful API
A restful API is an application programming interface which can be used by multiple clients to communicate with a server

### Benefits:
- Easily modified
- Used in a large scale
- Relies on HTTP standard
- good performance
- The client and server are both independent

### Benefits in Python
By using Python and REST APIs, you can retrieve, parse, update, and manipulate the data provided by any web service you're interested in.

Basically, there is a system we want to communicate with, we cant access the internals of the system, we can only talk to the API layer - end point
End point - point of contact - url
